Assume $x$ is an $m$-dimensional vector, prove $||x||_{\infty} \leq ||x||_{2}$ and $||x||_{2} \leq \sqrt{m} ||x||_{\infty}$.
}

Recall that 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:norm-def}
    ||x||_{2} &= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m} |x_{i}|^{2}} \\
    ||x||_{\infty} &= \max \{ |x_1|,|x_2|, \ldots, |x_{m}| \} 
.\end{align}

Thus, for the first inequality we have the following.
Suppose that $|x_{k}| = ||x||_{\infty}$, then
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:derive-1st-inequality}
    \eqbox{
    ||x||_{2} = \sqrt{||x||_{\infty}^2 + \sum_{i \ne k} |x_{i}|^2} \leq \sqrt{||x||_{\infty}^2} \leq ||x||_{\infty}
}
,\end{eqnarray}
since $|x_{i}| \geq 0$ for all $i$.

For the second inequality, we know that $|x_{i}| \leq ||x||_{\infty}$ for all $i$.
Hence,
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:derive-2nd-inequality}
    \eqbox{
    ||x||_{2} \leq \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m} ||x||_{\infty}^2} = \sqrt{m}||x||_{\infty} 
}
.\end{eqnarray}

Show that if a matrix $A$ is both triangular and unitary, then it is diagonal.
}

Suppose that $A = (a_{ij}) \in \complexs^{n \times n}$ is an upper triangular matrix we know that $a_{ij} = 0$ if $i > j$.
Furthermore, we know that $A A^{\dagger} = A^{\dagger}A = 1$.
Using the definition of matrix multiplication, we see that
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:A-Adag}
    (A^{\dagger} A)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ki}^{*}a_{kj} = \delta_{ij} 
,\end{eqnarray}
where $\displaystyle \delta_{ij} = \begin{cases}
    1 & i = j \\
    0 & i \ne j
\end{cases}$.
Since $A$ is upper triangular, it immediately follows that $A^{\dagger}$ is lower triangular. 
Hence, we find that $(A^{\dagger}A)_{11} = 1 = |a_{11}|^2$ or that $|a_{11}| = 1$.
Next, we observe that $(A^{\dagger} A)_{12} = 0 = a_{11}^{*}a_{12}$, which implies that $a_{12} = 0$.
Suppose that it is true that $a_{12},\ldots,a_{1 m} = 0$ for some $m < n$, then $(A^{\dagger} A)_{1,m+1} = 0 = a_{1 1}^{*}a_{1,m + 1}$, which implies that $a_{1,m+1} = 0$.
This argument can be continued for the elements above the diagonal of $A$ for each row.
Hence, $a_{ij} = 0$ if $i > j$.

Now suppose that $A$ is lower triangular and unitary.
Then, $A^{\dagger}$ is upper triangular and unitary, which implies that $A^{\dagger}$ is diagonal.
It immediately follows then that $A$ is diagonal.

Prove that matrix $\infty$-norm is

    ||A||_{\infty} = \max_{i} \sum_{j=1}^{n} |a_{ij}|

    Let $|| \cdot ||$ denote any norm on $\complexs$ and also the induced matrix norm on $\complexs^{m \times m}$.
Show that $\rho(A) \leq ||A||$, where $\rho$ is the spectral radius of $A$, which is the largest absolute value of an eigenvalue of $A$.
